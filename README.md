# Explainable Deep Few-shot Learning on the Cloud and its Application in Medical Imaging Informatics (<a href="http://www.isvc.net/index.php/tutorials/" target="_blank">ISVC 2023 Tutorials</a>) 
# <a href="http://www.isvc.net/" target="_blank">18th International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC 2023)</a>

## Tutorial
<p align="justify">The current tutorial at ISVC 2023 aims to offer a professional forum to share state-of-the-art in few-shot learning medical image analysis research , and how we can tackle the problem using high-performance cloud infrastructure, while we are also providing model explainability and interpretability. Moreover, this hands-on-practice tutorial teaches how to implement explainable deep few-shot learning for two clinical use cases, including: (1) object localization, and (2) image segmentation on the cloud. It will also facilitate interactions among students, researchers, developers, and physicians who are interested in deep learning explainability and learning from a few-samples in medical imaging informatics.</p>

<p align="justify">Upholding fairness in AI models for medical image segmentation is not only an ethical imperative but also crucial for building trust in AI systems within the medical community and among patients. Transparent and accountable AI algorithms, coupled with comprehensive data collection and evaluation, can help identify and rectify biases present in the training data or the algorithmic decision-making process. This iterative process of refinement and evaluation ensures that AI models produce consistent and equitable results, contributing to the overall quality and fairness of healthcare delivery. The current <a href="https://pittnail.github.io/EBAIC" target="_blank"><strong>Tutorial/Hackathon</strong></a> mainly aims to provide hands-on-practices in building fair and unbiased deep learning image segmentation in knee/hip bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs.</p>

### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee/hip radiographs (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee/hip X-ray images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
