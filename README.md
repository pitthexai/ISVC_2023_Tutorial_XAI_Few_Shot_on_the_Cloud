## Tutorial
<p align="justify">Deep learning computer vision algorithms have already demonstrated successful applications in a variety of medical image analysis tasks, including image registration, image segmentation, anomaly detection, object localization, and image classification. While scientific progress in deep learning and pattern recognition has led to advanced medical imaging strategies with almost human-like performance, there are still some fundamental issues that restrict deep learning methods to achieve their full potential in clinical practice. Evidently, deep learning medical image analysis often needs a large column of manually annotated training images to perform well, and they are also challenged by their explainability and interpretability. Furthermore, training and validating deep learning algorithms are computationally expensive. The former raises a set of problems, including but not limited to: (1) annotating medical images requires significant medical knowledge which makes the annotation process expensive and very time consuming, and (2) providing a large amount of annotated medical images is basically challenging due to high privacy-preserving standards in the healthcare community. The two latter, however, become vital for their application in clinical use cases.</p>

<p align="justify">The <strong>current tutorial at ISVC 2023</strong> aims to offer a professional forum to share state-of-the-art in few-shot learning medical image analysis research , and how we can tackle the problem using high-performance cloud infrastructure, while we are also providing model explainability and interpretability. Moreover, this hands-on-practice tutorial teaches how to implement explainable deep few-shot learning for two clinical use cases, including: (1) object localization, and (2) image segmentation on the cloud. It will also facilitate interactions among students, researchers, developers, and physicians who are interested in deep learning explainability and learning from a few-samples in medical imaging informatics.</p>

### Cloud Infrastructure

<p align="justify">We will be using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/" target="_blank">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>. </p>

### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee/hip radiographs (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee/hip X-ray images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual localization bounding boxes and segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
